## Analysis
 This simple automaton pretty clearly proves Mill's arguments for free speech.
 When wrong ideas are censored, it limits the ability to challenge and subsequently
 strenghten correct ideas. Because of this, there are less correct ideas on average
 with censorship as well as more incorrect ideas. This proves Mill's arguments for
 free speech. While I don't think it's plausible to include this for a challenge, 
 this simulation doesn't take into account peer pressure and the bandwagon falacy.
 Especially in childre, even if all of their friends are wrong, people don't want
 to go against the grain and be right. Most people would rather fit in and be wrong
 than to dissent and stand out. That would make this automaton much more complex, but
 also more accurate.
